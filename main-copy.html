      <p>What is OBE?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="info">
      Outcome-based education (OBE) is education in which an emphasis is placed
      on a clearly articulated idea of what students are expected to know and be
      able to do, that is, what skills and knowledge they need to have, when
      they leave the school system. It is sometimes also called
      performance-based education and is an attempt to measure educational
      effectiveness based on results rather than on inputs such as time students
      spend in class.
